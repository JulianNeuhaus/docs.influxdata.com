## Is this new version Chronograf a Grafana replacement?
No. One of the key features added to Chronograf was to make [Kapacitor](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/latest/) easier to use by providing it with a user interface. The new user interface makes it easy for users to see their data, set alerts, and quickly experiment with the settings without having to create and upload a TICKscript. We are still big fans of Grafana and will continue to offer it with our InfluxCloud solution. 

## Can I continue to use the closed source version of Chronograf?
Yes. The open source release of Chronograf should be viewed as a bare-bones release to get into the hands of the community for testing and feedback. We will be updating this project roughly every 2 weeks based on early adopter feedback. In the meantime, users can continue to use the closed source version of Chronograf. The closed source documentation is available under [Chronograf Versions](https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/latest/) at the bottom of the the left navigation bar.
